My .jar file is set to validate tables. So run the project in eclipse first which is set to create tables.
The Schema is uses is called character_manager so you will have to create this Schema in your workbench before running it.

Why are we doing this?
As a long term World of Warcraft player i thought it would be nice to be able to store all your characters
in one place. This would stop me searching though the many realms i have characters on to find the one I'm after.
Plus it will give me great experiance in building API's.

How I expected the challenge to go
I was quite worried about the project to begin with. It felt daunting and that i would never get it done. Once i got
started tho I found it went alot better then I thought it was going to.

What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
The project went a lot better then i was excepting. The only main issue i had was testing the DTO's but
got there in the end.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project
A lot of features could be added to this project. Adding a list of characters that you play the most or even adding what
items a character has. Would be great to build a frontend for this at some point.
